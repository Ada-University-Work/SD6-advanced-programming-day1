C++ Programming Exercises for Workshop 1-2A, B and C

## 1-2A
### Exercise 1
***Exercise:***
Ask the user for a quote and the author and then display the input in the format: ***author says: "quote"***

***Status:***
I have fully completed this exercise. The programme works correctly when given standard input.
I was able to solve the 'multi word input' bug by using the getline() function. One bug identified is if the input includes quotes (e.g. "this is my quote") then the output will be quoted twice e.g. author says: ""this is my quote"".
I have not yet found a fix for this issue but since the risk is very low I have made this a low priority problem.
